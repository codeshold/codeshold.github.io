## Why Not【Iron-Fortified Rice Cereal】❌
1️⃣ **Priority**: Confirm if the baby is allergic to pure rice (⚠️ plain rice only).

2️⃣ Most iron-fortified rice cereals contain additives, posing allergy risks.

3️⃣ Even if not allergic to rice, some brands may trigger allergies 🤧.

4️⃣ **Scientific Advice**: Only try【iron-fortified rice cereal】after confirming no rice allergy 💯.


## Why Not【Rice Water, Burnt Rice Water, Rice Oil】❌
1️⃣ Drinking liquids lacks the【fine motor process of eating】, hindering brain development.

2️⃣ Nutritionally, rice oil is inferior to【breast milk🍼】.

3️⃣ **Core Purpose of Solids**: 🚩 Train swallowing, chewing, and coordination.

4️⃣ Solids require tongue movement and swallowing, promoting brain development. Start with【paste-like】foods.

## Why【Homemade Burnt Rice Paste】✅
#### 1️⃣ First, rule out **rice allergy** 🤧 (homemade, pure).
<br>

#### 2️⃣ `High Heat Destroys Allergens`—lower allergy risk even if allergic to rice.

- Rice allergens (e.g., storage proteins like α-globulin or profilin) may denature or degrade during frying or baking (process for burnt rice paste), disrupting their 3D structure.
<br>

#### 3️⃣ `Maillard Reaction Effect`—reduces allergenicity.

- The【charring】of burnt rice paste involves the **Maillard reaction** (non-enzymatic browning of sugars and proteins), altering allergen epitopes and `reducing allergenicity`.
<br>

#### 4️⃣ Eating paste vs. drinking water: the former aids `brain development`.

- Burnt rice paste trains swallowing, chewing, and `coordination`.
<br>

#### 5️⃣ Easier on sensitive stomachs and more digestible.
<br>

#### 6️⃣ Recommended Progression: Full burnt rice paste 👉 Half burnt rice paste 👉 Rice paste 👉 Iron-fortified rice cereal (branded).

- After `2 weeks`, transition to "iron-fortified rice cereal".
