## Experience from a 1560 CNY Consultation Fee (Important❗️❗️❗️)

> **5 doctor visits**, **3 specialists**, **1 VIP consultation** 🟰 **1560**💰

1. For allergies, avoid regular probiotics; choose `anti-allergy` probiotics.

2. Criticized by experts: many probiotics contain `allergenic additives`.

3. We tried two anti-allergy probiotics:
	- 1️⃣ **BioGaia (Recommended by Fudan Pediatric Hospital)**
	- 2️⃣ **Diproct M-16V (Recommended by Dr. Xu Chundi, Ruijin Hospital)**
		- M-16V is a specific bacterial strain.

4. Both are safe, preserved in `rapeseed oil`.
	- Unless allergic to rapeseed oil (rare), probiotics are safe.

5. BioGaia costs 150 CNY, but Dr. Xu recommended Diproct M-16V (260 CNY).
	- Her team validated its anti-allergy effects.

6. **Never mix probiotics**.
	- We switched from BioGaia to Diproct M-16V (used for 1 month).

## Probiotic Struggles (Frustrating 😓 + Expensive 💰)
- 💢 Each doctor recommended `different probiotics`.
- 💢 Confusing for parents:
	- Only `BioGaia` and `Diproct M-16V` were anti-allergy.
	- Others were used for only 3-5 days.
- 💢 Prices ranged from **10 CNY** to **260 CNY**.
- 💢 Thought BioGaia was the `Hermès of probiotics`, but Diproct was pricier.
- 💢 `No limit to how expensive it can get`.
