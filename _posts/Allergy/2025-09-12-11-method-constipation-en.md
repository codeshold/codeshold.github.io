## ✅ Method 1: Avoid Allergens
#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Check recent foods to identify potential allergens
	- ⭕️ Mother's diet (if breastfeeding)
	- ⭕️ Formula
	- ⭕️ Solid foods
- If formula allergy is suspected, consider switching
	- Partially hydrolyzed, extensively hydrolyzed, or amino acid-based

#### 📚 Principle:
> Allergies can cause intestinal inflammation and dysfunction, leading to poor digestion and constipation.
> Removing the allergen "root cause" allows the gut to recover and alleviates constipation.


## ✅ Method 2: Apples/Dragon Fruit/Prunes
> Increase dietary fiber intake; combine with ✅`Method 3`.

#### 🤔 How to do it:

| Category | Foods | Notes |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Fruits | 🍎 Apples, dragon fruit, prunes | Dietary fiber, sorbitol |
| Vegetables | 🥦 Broccoli puree, spinach puree | Dietary fiber |
| Whole Grains | 🌾 Oatmeal or barley porridge (❌ not pure rice flour) | Dietary fiber |

#### 📚 Principle:
> Fiber: Absorbs water, softens stool, and stimulates bowel movements.
> Sorbitol: A natural mild laxative.


## ✅ Method 3: Hydration/Water
> 💦

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Offer extra **warm water** between meals.
- Older babies: Small amounts of diluted juice
	- E.g., **prune juice**, pear juice
	- Avoid excessive amounts to prevent reduced milk intake.

#### 📚 Principle:
> Fiber needs water to work effectively.
> Otherwise, it may worsen constipation.


## ✅ Method 4: Abdominal Massage (Physical Method)

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Technique:
	- Lay the baby on their back; warm your hands.
	- Use fingertips to gently massage in a **clockwise** direction around the navel.
- Duration: 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times daily.
- **Clockwise** direction aligns with the colon's natural movement.

#### 📚 Principle:
> Physical stimulation promotes bowel movements safely and without side effects.


## ✅ Method 5: Bicycle Legs (Physical Method)
> 🚴

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Technique:
	- Lay the baby on their back; hold their legs.
	- Gently alternate bending and extending, mimicking cycling.
- Duration: 5-10 minutes, several times daily.

#### 📚 Principle:
> Passive exercise stimulates abdominal muscles and intestines indirectly.


## ✅ Method 6: Warm Bath (Physical Method)
> 🛀

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Soak the baby in warm water (37°C) for 5-10 minutes.
- Dry and keep warm afterward.

#### 📚 Principle:
> Warm water relaxes muscles, including the anal sphincter, easing discomfort.


## ✅ Method 7: Probiotics (Microbiome Balance)
> Can combine with ✅`Method 8` (Prebiotics).

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Use allergy-friendly probiotics like:
  - **LGG** (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG)
  - **BB-12** (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis).

#### 📚 Principle:
> Allergies and constipation are linked to gut microbiome imbalance.
> Specific strains like LGG and BB-12 are clinically proven to help.


## ✅ Method 8: Prebiotics
> Common prebiotics: 1️⃣ FOS, 2️⃣ GOS, 3️⃣ HMO.

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Breastfeed or switch to **HMO formula**.
- Use probiotics with **prebiotics**.
- Eat prebiotic-rich foods like:
	- 🍌 Bananas, asparagus
	- Oats, onions.

#### 📚 Principle:
> Prebiotics feed beneficial gut bacteria and are a type of fiber.


## ✅ Method 9: Lactulose
> 🍬

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Administer **lactulose syrup** (prescribed by a doctor).

#### 📚 Principle:
> A gentle osmotic laxative that softens stool by retaining water.


## ✅ Method 10: PEG (Polyethylene Glycol)
> 💊

- Used as an **osmotic laxative** (e.g., Miralax).
- Requires a doctor's prescription; age restrictions apply:
	- 🇺🇸 FDA-approved for **≥6 months** ⚠️
	- Typically prescribed for **≥1 year** in some regions ⚠️

#### 📚 Principle:
> A first-line treatment for pediatric constipation per guidelines.


## ✅ Method 11: Glycerin Suppositories (Emergency)
> 💊

#### 🤔 How to do it:
- Use **glycerin suppositories** for severe cases (e.g., before medical tests).

#### 📚 Principle:
> Provides immediate relief but avoid frequent use to prevent dependency.
