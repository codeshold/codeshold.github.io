## 📚 Principles (Allergy 🆚 Intolerance)

|🧑‍🎓|Allergy|Intolerance|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Mechanism**|**Immune System**<br>Misjudgment and overreaction|**Digestive System**<br>Insufficient processing capacity|
|**Example**|Casein in milk<br>is mistakenly identified|Insufficient protease secretion<br>leads to xx intolerance|
|**Dosage**|Generally<br>unrelated to amount consumed|Related<br>Discomfort occurs beyond certain amount|
|**Possible<br>Reactions**|Respiratory,<br>digestive, skin, systemic...|**Diarrhea**, **bloating**,<br>**indigestion**, development...|
|**Testing**|IgE testing<br>Usually requires venous blood|IgG testing<br>Usually requires finger prick blood|

- Confirmation of `leaky gut` includes **food intolerance testing**, gut microbiome testing, etc.
	- Intolerance is more chronic and harder to detect
- Allergies and intolerances often occur together and influence each other


<br>

## 1️⃣ Intolerance Testing Scenario: Low Weight
> Example from a Shanghai mom in our group

|--|Description|Key Points|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Problem**|Baby 1+ years old, no allergy symptoms<br>Large appetite for milk and food, grows in height but not weight<br>Easily gets sick, no clue😓|🈚️ No reactions,<br>just not gaining weight|
|Testing|Found 🥚`egg intolerance`<br>(eats eggs regularly)|😯 Surprised<br>Chronic intolerance all along|
|Follow-up|1. Stop eating eggs🥚<br>Wait for gut recovery <br> 2. Gradually build tolerance|⏸️ After stopping,<br>obviously `started gaining weight`|

#### Summary:
- When 👶 development is slow but no clues, boldly do the test❗️
	- Simplest way to reduce parental anxiety


<br>
<br>

## 2️⃣ Intolerance Testing Scenario: Parents Test → Baby Food
> Example from my `friend` (Shanghai)

|--|Description|Key Points|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Problem**|`Sensitive baby` 6+ months, frequent eczema<br>Dad has allergy history, difficulty with solid foods<br>Fragile gut, diarrhea|⚠️Difficulty adding solid foods<br>Diarrhea when adding new foods|
|Testing|Baby too young, testing `may be inaccurate`<br>Decided parents get tested, based on results<br>arrange baby's food plan|👍Rational approach for<br>young babies|
|Follow-up|1. Avoid `both parents' intolerant foods` <br> 2. Try high-risk foods later|🈚️No more anxiety,<br>solid food introduction goes smoothly|

#### Summary:
- When 👶 has difficulty with solid foods, slow food introduction, fragile gut, and anxiety, boldly do the test❗️

<br>
<br>

## 3️⃣ Intolerance Testing Scenario: Family Correlation
> Example from a Shandong mom in our group

|--|Description|Key Points|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Problem**|Younger baby 8+ months, found allergies<br>Started `suspecting 4+ years older sibling`<br> Older sibling allergy test ok <br> But easily gets 😷, underweight|⚠️Younger baby's allergies<br>drew attention to older sibling|
|Testing|Older sibling got tested<br>Found wheat intolerance|😱Parents shocked<br>Northern Chinese🌾 intolerant|
|Follow-up|1. Stop wheat, switch to rice <br> 2. Gradually build tolerance|😄Older sibling looks better<br>Less prone to 😷, gradually gaining weight|

#### Summary:
- Allergies and intolerances generally have strong genetic🧬 factors, need to pay attention to family correlations

## 4️⃣ Intolerance Testing Scenario: 🤧 Sensitive Baby
> Example from a Xinjiang mom in our group

|--|Description|Key Points|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Problem**|`Sensitive baby` 11+ months, prone to diarrhea<br>Solid food introduction, sometimes good sometimes bad<br>Same food shows inconsistent reactions|😡Same food<br>reactions `inconsistent`|
|Testing|All allergy tests done<br>Eosinophils, 💩 all normal<br>Decided to do food intolerance test|👍High probability of<br>intolerance in sensitive babies|
|Follow-up|Special handling of intolerant foods <br>Like not adding after colds|👶Immediate improvement<br>No more inconsistencies|

#### Summary:
- Avoid immediately adding intolerant foods in these situations:
	- Such as: after baby catches cold😷, after vaccination💉, other special circumstances

## 🤔 How to Choose Testing Products❓
|--|✅ Correct Approach|Description|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1️⃣|`**Home Testing**`|Convenient, cost-effective<br>Key is the test reagents|
|2️⃣|**Reputable Brands**|Reliable service and quality<br>(Since spending 💰, choose reliable ones)|
|3️⃣|Generally<br>**40+ Items**|Covers basic `Chinese diet` structure <br>Suitable for most scenarios|

> 🤧 Due to my own sensitive baby, I've been sharing for 8 months, built 5 discussion groups👗, one public 【Large Model Knowledge Base】, and met many parents...
Living with sensitive babies also involves 【Food Intolerance】, and the most discussed question is👉【When to do food intolerance testing】?
>
>🌈 Based on actual historical cases, I've summarized 4️⃣ recommended scenarios:
>
>✅ 1. Slow development, low weight
>- Hardest situation to detect
>
>✅ 2. Slow solid food introduction, difficult food trial
>- For young babies, can arrange based on parents' results
>
>✅ 3. Family history of allergies or intolerances
>- Genetic factors of allergies/intolerances need special attention
>
>✅ 4. Sensitive baby - symptoms inconsistent😷
>- Sensitive baby is a long-term battle, food intolerance too
